Codebase for Analysing the Hateful Memes Dataset    

by :- Tarun Teppala

Preface: The code has been tuned to run on a laptop GPU (Nvidia GTX 1650) and is extremely weak and unoptimized

The following are the objective tasks:

 - Object Detection
 - Caption Impact Assessment
 - Classification System Development
 - Bonus: Image-only label classifier
 - Bonus: Text-only label classifier

The code is organized in a Python Notebook, with modules for Imports, Pytorch classes for Preprocessing and running classification tasks
